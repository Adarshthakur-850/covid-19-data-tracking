Act as a senior Machine Learning Engineer.

Design and implement a complete end-to-end project titled:

“COVID-19 Data Tracking and Time-Series Forecasting using Deep Learning”

The objective is to build a real-world, production-quality system that tracks, analyzes, visualizes, and forecasts COVID-19 cases using deep learning on time-series data.

Use Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Plotly, and TensorFlow/Keras.

Use the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 time-series dataset (global confirmed, deaths, recovered cases).

Follow these strict requirements:

1. Project Architecture
   - Provide a clean, modular folder structure suitable for GitHub.
   - Separate modules for data processing, visualization, model, training, and forecasting.
   - Code must be clean and production-ready.

2. Data Engineering
   - Load the real dataset from source.
   - Perform preprocessing for time-series learning.
   - Handle missing values and anomalies.
   - Normalize/scale features.
   - Convert data into sliding window sequences for LSTM/GRU.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Plot cumulative vs daily cases.
   - Country-wise comparison plots.
   - Rolling averages and growth rate analysis.

4. Time-Series Visualization
   - Interactive or clear time-series plots.
   - Heatmap showing spread across countries.
   - Save plots as images.

5. Deep Learning Model
   - Implement LSTM as the primary model.
   - Implement GRU for comparison.
   - Proper train/test split for time-series.
   - Use EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint.
   - Plot training vs validation loss.

6. Forecasting
   - Predict next 30 days of cases.
   - Plot predicted vs actual values.
   - Save the trained model as .h5 file.

7. Evaluation
   - Calculate MAE, RMSE.
   - Provide performance comparison between LSTM and GRU.

8. Output Artifacts
   - requirements.txt
   - README.md content
   - Instructions to run locally
   - All plots saved to a /plots folder
   - Model saved to /models folder

9. Future Extension Readiness
   - Structure the project so it can later be wrapped with FastAPI and Docker without refactoring.

10. Deliverables Format
   - Provide code step-by-step for each file/module.
   - Show exact file names and folder structure.
   - Do not include explanations, only code and file content.
